# Shepherd

**Per-project PHP version switching on Windows — automatic, instant, zero-config.**

Drop a `.phpversion` file in your project, and `php` / `composer` use the right version. No manual switching, no batch scripts, no broken PATH.

```bash
# Inside project A
~/projects/api $ php -v
PHP 8.3.12 (cli) ...

# Just change directory — Shepherd handles the rest automatically
~/projects/api $ cd ../frontend
~/projects/frontend $ php -v
PHP 8.5.7 (cli) ...
```

## Why

Laravel Herd installs multiple PHP versions side by side, but doesn't let you pin a version per project from the CLI. The usual workaround is batch scripts wrapping `php.exe` — fragile, slow, and broken across terminals.

Shepherd replaces that with a single compiled binary (~2 MB) that acts as a transparent shim for `php` and `composer`. It reads `.phpversion`, resolves the right `php.exe` from Herd's installations, syncs nginx, and gets out of the way.

Shepherd does not alter your Herd installation or replace its binaries. It sits in your user profile PATH, layers on top of Herd, and falls back to Herd's default behavior when no project configuration is found.

No subshells. No recursion. No race conditions.

## Requirements

- [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com) for Windows
- Windows 10/11 (amd64 or arm64)

## Quick start

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/shaffe-fr/php-shepherd/releases)
2. Run `shp.exe` — it detects it's not installed and offers to set everything up:

```
Shepherd is not installed yet. Install now? [Y/n]
```

3. Restart your terminal, then:

```powershell
shp use 8.4      # writes .phpversion
php -v           # → PHP 8.4.x
composer install # → uses PHP 8.4
```

That's it. The installer places shims (`php.exe`, `composer.exe`, `shp.exe`) in `%USERPROFILE%\.config\shepherd\bin`, prepends it to your PATH, and broadcasts the change.

> **CI / non-interactive:** Use `shp install` in scripts. Interactive prompts are auto-skipped when stdin is not a terminal.

## How it works

1. Reads `.phpversion` from the current directory, walking up the tree (like `.nvmrc`)
2. Resolves the matching `php.exe` from Herd's installs (`~/.config/herd/bin/phpXX/`)
3. Falls back to `herd.phar which-php` when no dotfile is found
4. Syncs Herd's nginx config so your `.test` domain matches the CLI version
5. Execs the real `php.exe` — transparent, no wrapper overhead

## Xdebug management

Toggle xdebug without editing `php.ini` manually:

```powershell
shp xdebug on          # enable (mode=debug)
shp xdebug coverage    # switch to coverage mode
shp xdebug off         # disable
shp xdebug toggle      # quick on/off
```

Works on the PHP version resolved for the current project.

## Extension management

Install extensions not bundled with Herd — no manual DLL download:

```powershell
shp ext add redis
shp ext add imagick
shp ext add sqlsrv --php=all   # all installed versions
```

Supported: `igbinary`, `imagick`, `memcached`, `pdo_sqlsrv`, `redis`, `sqlsrv`.

Handles PECL lookup, DLL download, system deps (winget), ini registration, and verification.

## Self-update

```powershell
shp self-update
```

Downloads the latest release, verifies SHA256, and replaces all shims. Releases are signed with [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev) — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Multicall binary

The binary detects how it was invoked:

| Invoked as                  | Behavior                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `php` / `php.exe`           | Transparent PHP shim                  |
| `composer` / `composer.exe` | Runs `composer.phar` via resolved PHP |
| `shp.exe`                   | Management commands                   |

One binary, three names — `shp install` sets them all up.

## IDE integration

Point your IDE's PHP interpreter to the Shepherd shim so static analysis matches your terminal:

**PhpStorm:**
Settings → PHP → CLI Interpreter → `...` → Add Local → path:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.config\shepherd\bin\php.exe
```

**VS Code (Intelephense / PHP Intelephense):**
In `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "php.validate.executablePath": "${env:USERPROFILE}/.config/shepherd/bin/php.exe"
}
```

The shim resolves the correct PHP version per project, so the IDE always uses the same binary as your terminal.

## Troubleshooting

```powershell
shp doctor
```

Checks: Herd presence, `.phpversion` validity, shim installation, PATH order, shell aliases, Developer Mode, CA certificate, nginx config, PHP-CGI ports.

Common fixes:
- **Wrong PHP version** → `shp status` to check PATH order, then `shp install` + restart terminal
- **Version not found** → install it from the Herd UI
- **nginx errors** → `shp doctor` will report the file and line

## Build from source

```powershell
go build -ldflags="-s -w -X main.version=dev" -o shp.exe .
.\shp.exe install
```
